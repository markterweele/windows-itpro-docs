### Show notification bell icon

This policy setting allows you to show the notification bell icon in the system tray:

- If you enable this policy setting, the notification icon is always displayed
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the notification icon is only displayed when there's a special status (for example, when *do not disturb* is turned on)

> [!NOTE]
> A reboot is required for this policy setting to take effect.
