### Start layout

This policy setting lets you specify the Start layout for users, preventing them from changing its configuration. The Start layout you specify must be stored in an XML file that was generated by the `Export-StartLayout` PowerShell cmdlet. To use this setting, you must first manually configure a device's Start layout to the desired look and feel. Then, run the `Export-StartLayout` PowerShell cmdlet on that same device. The cmdlet generates an XML file representing the layout you configured. Once the XML file is generated and moved to the desired file path, use the fully qualified path and name of the XML file. You can use a local path, or a UNC path. If the specified file isn't available when the user signs in, the layout isn't changed. Users can't customize the Start layout while this setting is enabled. If you disable this setting or don't configure it, the Start screen layout isn't changed and users can customize it.
