# Unbranded Boot

Unbranded Boot is a Windows feature that allows you to suppress Windows elements that appear when Windows starts. It can also suppress the crash screen when Windows encounters an error that it can't recover from. This feature is useful for devices that are used in public spaces, such as kiosks and digital signs, where a clean and professional appearance is important.

## Enable Unbranded Boot

Unbranded Boot is an optional component and isn't enabled by default in Windows. To configure it, you must first enable it.

There are different ways to enable Unbranded Boot, select the method that best fits your needs to learn more.

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../images/icons/control-panel.svg"::: **Control Panel**](#tab/control-panel1)

To enable Unbranded Boot using the Control Panel, follow these steps:

1. Open **Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Turn Windows features on or off** or use the command `optionalfeatures.exe`
1. Expand **Device Lockdown** and select **Unbranded Boot**
1. Select **OK** to enable Unbranded Boot
1. Restart your device to apply the changes

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../images/icons/powershell.svg"::: **PowerShell**](#tab/powershell1)

To enable Unbranded Boot using PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. Open a PowerShell window with administrator privileges
1. Run the following command:
    ```powershell
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName Client-DeviceLockdown,Client-EmbeddedBootExp -Online
    ```
1. Restart your device to apply the changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first user to sign in to the device must be an administrator. This ensures that the **RunOnce** registry settings correctly apply the settings. Also, when using auto sign-in, you must not configure auto sign-in on your device at design time. Instead, auto sign-in should be configured manually after first signing in as an administrator.

## Configure Unbranded Boot

The following instructions provide details about how to configure your devices. Select the option that best suits your needs.

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../images/icons/cmd.svg"::: **Command prompt**](#tab/cmd)

You can use the `bcdedit.exe` command to configure Unbranded Boot settings at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> `Bcdedit.exe` is a command-line tool for editing the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) of Windows. Administrator privileges are required to use BCDEdit to modify the BCD.

1. Open a command prompt as an administrator
1. Run the following command to disable the F8 key during startup to prevent access to the **Advanced startup options** menu

   ```cmd
   bcdedit.exe -set {globalsettings} advancedoptions false
   ```

1. Run the following command to disable the F10 key during startup to prevent access to the **Advanced startup options** menu

   ```cmd
   bcdedit.exe -set {globalsettings} optionsedit false
   ```

1. Run the following command to suppress all Windows UI elements (logo, status indicator, and status message) during startup

   ```cmd
   bcdedit.exe -set {globalsettings} bootuxdisabled on
   ```

1. Run the following command to suppress any error screens that are displayed during boot. If **noerrordisplay** is on and the boot manager hits a *WinLoad Error* or *Bad Disk Error*, the system displays a black screen

   ```cmd
   bcdedit.exe -set {bootmgr} noerrordisplay on
   ```

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../images/icons/xml.svg"::: **Unattend**](#tab/unattend)

You can configure the Unattend settings in the `Microsoft-Windows-Embedded-BootExp` component to add Unbranded Boot features to your image during the design or imaging phase. You can manually create an Unattend answer file or use Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM) to add the appropriate settings to your answer file. For more information about the Unbranded Boot settings and XML examples, see the settings in [Microsoft-Windows-Embedded-BootExp](/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-embedded-bootexp).

#### [:::image type="icon" source="../images/icons/provisioning-package.svg"::: **PPKG**](#tab/ppkg)

Customize the boot screen using Windows Configuration Designer and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM).

You must enable Unbranded Boot on the installation media with DISM before you can apply settings for Unbranded Boot using either Windows Configuration Designer or applying a provisioning package during setup.

If Windows is already installed, you can't apply a provisioning package to configure Unbranded Boot. You must use the command prompt to configure Unbranded Boot if Windows is installed.

[!INCLUDE [provisioning-package-1](../../../includes/configure/provisioning-package-1.md)]

|Path|Value|
|---|---|
|`Runtime settings/SMISettings/HideAllBootUI`| `TRUE` or `FALSE`|
|`Runtime settings/SMISettings/HideBootLogo`| `TRUE` or `FALSE`|
|`Runtime settings/SMISettings/HideBootStatusIndicator`| `TRUE` or `FALSE`|
|`Runtime settings/SMISettings/HideBootStatusMessage`| `TRUE` or `FALSE`|

> [!TIP]
> For more information, see [SMISettings](/windows/configuration/wcd/wcd-smisettings) in the Windows Configuration Designer reference.

Once you finish to configure the settings and building the package or image, use DISM to apply the settings:

1. Open a command prompt with administrator privileges
1. Copy `install.wim` to a temporary folder on the hard drive (for example, `c:\wim`)
1. Create a new directory to mount the image:

    ```cmd
    md c:\wim
    ```
1. Mount the image:
    ```cmd
    dism /mount-wim /wimfile:c:\bootmedia\sources\install.wim /index:1 /MountDir:c:\wim
    ```
1. Enable the feature:
    ```cmd
    dism /image:c:\wim /enable-feature /featureName:Client-EmbeddedBootExp
    ```
1. Commit the change:
    ```cmd
    dism /unmount-wim /MountDir:c:\wim /Commit
    ```

## Replace the startup logo

The only supported way to replace the startup logo with a custom logo is to modify the Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT) on a device that uses UEFI as the firmware interface. If your device uses the BGRT to include a custom logo, it's always displayed and you can't suppress the custom logo.
