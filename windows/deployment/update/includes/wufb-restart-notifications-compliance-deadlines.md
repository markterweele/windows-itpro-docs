These deadline policies also offer an option to opt out of automatic restarts until a deadline is reached by presenting an "engaged restart experience" until the deadline passes. At that point, the device automatically schedules a restart regardless of active hours.

These notifications are what the user sees depending on the settings you choose, and what operating system version their device is running. Generally, the user notifications become more noticeable as the deadline approaches. The experience described is the default and assumes there's ample time for notifications before the [effective deadline](../wufb-compliancedeadlines.md) occurs. The description doesn't account for changes to the **Display options for update notifications** policy ([Update/NoUpdateNotificationsDuringActiveHours](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#noupdatenotificationsduringactivehours)) or other settings that would significantly change the experience. 

# [Windows 11, version 23H2 and later](#tab/23h2)

When **Specify deadlines for automatic updates and restarts** is set for Windows 11, version 23H2 and later: 

While restart is pending, before the deadline occurs, users receive a toast notification in the corner of their screen. The notification includes the deadline date, and options to either restart now, pick a time to restart, or restart tonight once active hours ends. 

- If the user set [the option](../waas-wufb-csp-mdm.md#user-settings-for-notifications) **Settings** > **Windows Update** > **Advanced options** > **Notify me when a restart is required to finish updating** to **On**, they immediately receive the toast notification when the device enters a restart pending state for updates. Automatic restarts for updates are blocked for 24 hours after the initial notification to give these users time to prepare.
- If the user set **Notify me when a restart is required to finish updating** to **Off** (default), they receive a toast notification that a restart is required 24 hours after the device enters a restart pending state for updates.

Toast notifications occur about every 27 hours until the day of the deadline. During this time, if they're allowed, automatic restarts might be scheduled after active hours. If an automatic restart is scheduled or the user scheduled the restart, and the user is signed in at that time, they receive a notification 15 minutes before the scheduled time.

The notification contains the deadline time and options to restart now or acknowledge the notification" lightbox="../media/9091858-pre-deadline-restart-imminent.png":::

About 4 hours before the deadline time, a notification displays in the middle of the screen that contains the deadline time and options to restart now or acknowledge the notification.

The notification contains the options to restart now or confirm the notification." lightbox="../media/9091858-fifteen-minutes-restart.png":::

In cases where a user scheduled restart fails but there's still more time before the deadline is reached, the user receives a notification to either restart now or to reschedule the restart.

In cases where the deadline has passed, the user receives a notification that a restart is required. The only option a user can select is to restart now. The user has 15 minutes to select restart before the device is forced to restart.

In cases where the deadline has passed and the restart failed, the user receives a notification that a restart is required. If the device is plugged in, it will attempt to restart every 5 minutes until the device successfully restarts. The user has 5 minutes to restart before the device is forced to restart.
