      - question: What does Windows Autopatch do to ensure updates are done successfully?
        answer: |
          For Windows quality and feature updates, updates are applied to devices in a gradual manner. There's an evaluation period at each progression. This process is dependent on customer testing and verification of all updates during these rollout stages. The outcome is to ensure that registered devices are always up to date and disruption to business operations is minimized to free up your IT department from that ongoing task.
      - question: What happens if there's an issue with an update?
        answer: |
          Autopatch relies on the following capabilities to help resolve update issues:
          - Pausing and resuming: For more information about pausing and resuming updates, see [pausing and resuming Windows quality updates](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#pause-and-resume-a-release).
          - Rollback: For more information about Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, see [Update controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../manage/windows-autopatch-microsoft-365-apps-enterprise.md#microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise-update-controls).
      - question: Can I configure when to move to the next ring or is it controlled by Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          You're in full control over when updates are deployed to their devices. Autopatch groups will recommend a set of intelligent defaults but those are fully customizable so that you can achieve your desired rollout.
  - name: Support
    questions:
      - question: Does Windows Autopatch Support Dual Scan for Windows Update?
        answer: |
          Dual Scan for Windows has been deprecated and replaced with the [scan source policy](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-wsus). Windows Autopatch supports the scan source policy if the Feature updates, and Windows quality updates workloads are configured for Windows update. If Feature and Windows updates are configured for WSUS, it could cause disruptions to the service and your release schedules.
