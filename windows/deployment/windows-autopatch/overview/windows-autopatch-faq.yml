  - name: Manage updates
    questions:
      - question: Who can manage updates with Windows Autopatch?
        answer: | 
          Business Premium, A3+, E3+ and F3 licenses can manage updates with Windows Autopatch. For more information, see [Features and capabilities](../overview/windows-autopatch-overview.md#features-and-capabilities).
      - question: What systems does Windows Autopatch update?
        answer: |
          - Windows 10/11 quality updates: Windows Autopatch manages all aspects of deployment rings.
          - Windows 10/11 feature updates: Windows Autopatch manages all aspects of deployment rings.
          - Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise updates: All devices registered for Windows Autopatch will receive updates from the Monthly Enterprise Channel.
          - Microsoft Edge: Windows Autopatch configures eligible devices to benefit from Microsoft Edge's progressive rollouts on the Stable channel and will provide support for issues with Microsoft Edge updates.
          - Microsoft Teams: Windows Autopatch allows eligible devices to benefit from the standard automatic update channels and will provide support for issues with Teams updates.
      - question: What does Windows Autopatch do to ensure updates are done successfully?
        answer: |
          For Windows quality and feature updates, updates are applied to devices in a gradual manner. There's an evaluation period at each progression. This process is dependent on customer testing and verification of all updates during these rollout stages. The outcome is to ensure that registered devices are always up to date and disruption to business operations is minimized to free up your IT department from that ongoing task.
      - question: What happens if there's an issue with an update?
        answer: |
          Autopatch relies on the following capabilities to help resolve update issues:
          - Pausing and resuming: For more information about pausing and resuming updates, see [pausing and resuming Windows quality updates](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#pause-and-resume-a-release).
          - Rollback: For more information about Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, see [Update controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../manage/windows-autopatch-microsoft-365-apps-enterprise.md#microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise-update-controls).
      - question: Can I configure when to move to the next ring or is it controlled by Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          You're in full control over when updates are deployed to their devices. Autopatch groups will recommend a set of intelligent defaults but those are fully customizable so that you can achieve your desired rollout.
      - question: What is the expected behavior for turning on the Feature Update option for Autopatch groups?
        answer: |
          Starting in April 2025, default policies aren't created for new Autopatch customers. Existing customers will continue to receive support until Windows 10 reaches its End-of-Service (EOS). However, these policies won't transition to Windows 11.
          
          If you created an Autopatch group before April 2025:
          - The Feature Update option is unselected by default.
          - Selecting the Feature Update option creates a feature update policy for the newly created Autopatch group. This doesn't affect the Global DSS policy.
          - The Feature Update option doesn't affect existing releases created before April 2025; these releases remain unchanged
          
          If you created an Autopatch group after April 2025:
          - Selecting the Feature Update option creates a feature update policy and assigns it to all its deployment rings.
          - Global DSS policy isn't affected.
  - name: Hotpatch updates
    questions:
      - question: What are the licensing requirements for hotpatch updates?
        answer: |
          Windows 11 Enterprise E3 or E5, Windows 11 Enterprise F3 or F5, Windows 11 Education A3 or A5, or a Windows 365 Enterprise license. For more information, see [Prerequisites](../prepare/windows-autopatch-prerequisites.md).
      - question: Can I still restart devices as often as I want?
        answer: |
          Yes, devices that install hotpatch updates are protected the moment the update is installed. However, if a user or your IT Admin wishes to restart the PC you can do it anytime. The device restarts and runs the hotpatch updates.
      - question: Can I use hotpatch updates on Arm64 devices?
        answer: |
          Yes, hotpatch updates are available for Arm64 devices. For more information, see [Arm 64 devices must disable compiled hybrid PE usage (CHPE) (Arm 64 CPU Only)](../manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates.md#arm-64-devices-must-disable-compiled-hybrid-pe-usage-chpe-arm-64-cpu-only)).
      - question: What is the default hotpatch behavior on Windows Home or Pro devices?
        answer: |
          Hotpatch updates aren't available to Home or Pro devices. Hotpatching requires domain admin or group policy. It's available only via Windows Autopatch update policy, which includes Windows 365 Enterprise, E3/E5, F3 and A3/A5 licenses. 
      - question: How do I enroll devices to receive hotpatch updates?
        answer: |
          For more information, see [Enroll devices to receive hotpatch updates](../manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates.md#enroll-devices-to-receive-hotpatch-updates).
      - question: What if some devices in my hotpatch policy aren't eligible for hotpatch updates?
        answer: |
          For more information on eligibility, see [Prerequisites](../prepare/windows-autopatch-prerequisites.md) and [ineligible devices](../manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates.md#ineligible-devices).
      - question: How is hotpatching different for Windows 11 Enterprise and Windows Server 2025?
        answer: |
          For more information, see [Hotpatch on Windows 11 Enterprise or Windows Server 2025](../manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates.md#hotpatch-on-windows-11-enterprise-or-windows-server-2025).
      - question: How can I tell which of my devices installed a hotpatch update?
        answer: |
          Devices receiving the hotpatch update have a different KB number tracking the release and a different OS version than devices receiving the standard update that requires a restart. The monthly KB release articles indicate if the KB installed is hotpatch capable and the corresponding OS version. The following Windows Update message appears “Great news! The latest security update was installed without a restart.”
      - question: What if I restart a device after receiving a hotpatch update?
        answer: |
          The device stays on the hotpatch update KB/OS version after a restart. It won't receive any new features as part of the regular servicing track until the next quarterly cumulative baseline update. 
      - question: Do hotpatch updates only update common system binaries loaded in third-party processes or only Microsoft processes?
        answer: |
          Hotpatch updates aren't limited to Microsoft processes. Hotpatch updates are only created for OS binaries. Any process loading OS binaries that have hotpatch updates installed are updated before the application or operating system uses the binaries. This includes common system dynamic link libraries (DLLs) like ntdll.dll. 
      - question: How can I find out if a hotpatch update was applied to the specific DLL?
        answer: | 
          You can see the hotpatch modules in the memory dump. Symbols for hotpatched DLLs depend on the function that receives the update. Some code that is hotpatch-updated could be public (symbols), while other functions could be private (no symbols).  
      - question: Are there kernel-mode hotpatch updates?
        answer: |
          Yes, there are kernel-mode hotpatch updates.
      - question: What does a failure to apply a hotpatch update look like?
        answer: |
          Hotpatch failures are the same as CBS failures when installing other KBs (not enough disk space or download errors for example). In addition, hotpatch update errors are recorded in the event logs. Search the system log for the keyword “hotpatch” to see if your system encountered any errors.
      - question: Can you switch from hotpatch update to the Standard Windows monthly updates?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can. You can manually download the standard Windows monthly update from the Microsoft Update Catalog. In this case, the device stops receiving hotpatch updates and receives standard Windows updates until the month after the next baseline update. Since the device is still enrolled in hotpatching, the device automatically rejoins the hotpatch cadence of updates after the update is released on the baseline month.
      - question: How do hotpatch update events show up in audit logs?
        answer: |
          Process explorer shows it loaded in memory OS ``<binary name>_hotpatch`` loaded in memory. The hotpatch update KB includes a link to the CSV file listing the update payload. 
      - question: Can I get security alerts through Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) about hotpatch updates?
        answer: |
          Hotpatch events are captured in the audit log. Search for “hotpatch” in the audit log to find related errors if any were captured.
      - question: Do I need to test hotpatch updates if I already test monthly updates?
        answer: |
          You should test hotpatch updates when released 8 times a year (according to plan) and the regular monthly updates 12 times a year. There are no hotpatch updates for you to test in January (1B), April (4B), July (7B), or October (10B).
  - name: Support
    questions:
      - question: Does Windows Autopatch Support Dual Scan for Windows Update?
        answer: |
          Dual Scan for Windows has been deprecated and replaced with the [scan source policy](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-wsus). Windows Autopatch supports the scan source policy if the Feature updates, and Windows quality updates workloads are configured for Windows update. If Feature and Windows updates are configured for WSUS, it could cause disruptions to the service and your release schedules.
