# Privacy

Windows Autopatch is a cloud service for enterprise customers designed to keep Windows devices updated. This article provides details about data platform and privacy compliance for Windows Autopatch.

## Windows Autopatch data sources and purpose

Autopatch collects and stores data according to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839).

When you use Windows Autopatch features, data from various sources is used to properly administer enrolled devices and monitor that the service is working properly.

The sources include Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Windows 10/11. The sources provide a comprehensive view of the devices that Windows Autopatch manages.

| Data source | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- |
| [Microsoft Windows 10/11 Enterprise](/windows/windows-10/) | Management of device setup experience, managing connections to other services, and operational support for IT pros. |
| [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) | Device management and to keep your data secure. The following endpoint management data sources are used:<br><ul><li>[Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/): Authentication and identification of all user accounts.</li><li>[Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/): Distributing device configurations, device management and application management.</li></ul> |
| [Windows Autopatch](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) | <ul><li>Uses Windows 10/11 Enterprise diagnostic data to provide additional information on Windows 10/11 update.</li><li>Data provided by the customer or generated by the service during running of the service.</li></ul> |

## Windows Autopatch data process

Windows Autopatch relies on data from multiple Microsoft products and services to provide its service to enterprise customers.
To protect and maintain enrolled devices, we process and copy data from these services to Windows Autopatch. When we process data, we follow the documented directions you provide as referenced in the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

Processor duties of Windows Autopatch include ensuring appropriate confidentiality, security, and resilience. Windows Autopatch employs additional privacy and security measures to ensure proper handling of personal identifiable data.

## Windows Autopatch data storage

Data obtained by Windows Autopatch and other services are required to keep the service operational. If a device is removed from Windows Autopatch, we keep data for a maximum of 30 days. For more information on data retention, see [Data retention, deletion, and destruction in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview).

Feature, quality, and driver update policy data is stored in only two regions, either in Azure's North American or European data center.

Windows Autopatch groups and Windows Autopatch Client Broker stores its data in the Azure data centers based on your data residency. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 data center locations](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations).

## Microsoft Windows 10/11 diagnostic data

Windows Autopatch uses Windows diagnostic data to keep Windows secure, up to date, and fix problems.

To take advantage of the unique deployment scheduling controls and protections tailored to your population, devices must share diagnostic data with Microsoft. For these features, at minimum, the deployment service requires devices to send [diagnostic data](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#diagnostic-data-settings) at the *Required* level for these features.

Windows Autopatch only processes and stores system-level data from Windows 10/11 optional diagnostic data that originates from enrolled devices. Windows Autopatch doesn't process and store customers' data such as chat and browser history, voice, text, or speech data.

For more information about the diagnostic data collection of Microsoft Windows 10/11, see the [Where we store and process data section](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule) of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

For more information about how Windows diagnostic data is used, see:

- [Features that require Windows diagnostic data](/mem/intune/protect/data-enable-windows-data)

## Microsoft Entra ID

Identifying data used by Windows Autopatch is stored by Microsoft Entra ID in a geographical location. The geographical location is based on the location provided by the organization upon subscribing to Microsoft online services, such as Microsoft Apps for Enterprise and Azure.

## Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise

These updates are based on predefined update channels managed by Windows Autopatch.
