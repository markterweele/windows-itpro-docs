# Submit a support request

Support requests are triaged and responded to as they're received.

**To submit a new support request:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and navigate to **Troubleshooting + support**.
1. In the **Troubleshooting + support** section, select **Help and support**.
1. In the **Help and support** section, select **Windows Autopatch**.
1. In the **Help** section, enter your questions and/or a description of the issue.
1. Review the links that are provided to try to help with the issue.
1. If the answers that were given don't help you resolve the issue, select **Contact support** at the bottom of the page.
1. Follow the instructions to file a support request with Windows Autopatch. Make sure you provide the correct primary contact information for this specific support ticket.  
1. When you're ready, select **Contact me**.

## Premier and Unified support options

If you have a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract, when you submit a new request, or edit an active support request, you can:

- Specify the severity of your issue
- Schedule a support callback for a specific day and time

Depending on your support contract, the following severity options are available:

| Support contract | Severity options |
| ----- | ----- |
| Premier | Severity A, B, or C |
| Unified | Critical or noncritical |

## Manage an active support request

The primary contact for the support request receives email notifications when a case is created, assigned to a service engineer to investigate, and mitigated. If, at any point, you have a question about the case, the best way to get in touch is to reply directly to one of those emails. If we have questions about your request or need more details, we email the primary contact listed on the support requests.

## View all your active support requests

You can see the summary status of all your support requests. At any time, you can use the portal to see all active support requests in the last six months.

**To view all your active support requests:**

1. Sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and navigate to **Troubleshooting + support**.
1. In the **Troubleshooting + support** section, select **Help and support**.
1. In the **Help and support** section, select **Windows Autopatch**.
1. Under **Windows Autopatch**, select **Support History** to view all filed support requests.
1. Once a support request is mitigated, a survey appears. Using the survey, the primary contact can rate their experience.
