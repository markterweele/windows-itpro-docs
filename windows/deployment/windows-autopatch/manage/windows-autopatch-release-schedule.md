# Manage the Release schedule

Windows Autopatch provides a unique update experience and a single view for all your current quality, feature, and driver and firmware releases. This view:

- Consolidates all your applicable policies into a view consolidated by releases
- Provides an all-up summary of the current release applicable to your tenant

When you select a release, Windows Autopatch provides a list view of associated policies and metrics including:

- Start and end dates
- percentage complete

These metrics are a summary of the individual workload views that should be used to manage your updates.
