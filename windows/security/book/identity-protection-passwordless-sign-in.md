Passwords are a fundamental part of digital security, but they're often inconvenient and vulnerable to cyberattacks. With Windows 11, users can enjoy passwordless protection, which offers a more secure and user-friendly alternative. After a secure authorization process, credentials are safeguarded by multiple layers of hardware and software security, providing users with seamless, passwordless access to their apps and cloud services.
