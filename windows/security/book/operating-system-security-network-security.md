Windows 11 raises the bar for network security, offering comprehensive protection to help people work with confidence from almost anywhere. To help reduce an organization's attack
surface, network protection in Windows prevents people from accessing dangerous IP addresses and domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content.
Using reputation-based services, network protection blocks access to potentially harmful, low-reputation domains and IP addresses.

New DNS and TLS protocol versions strengthen the end-to-end protections needed for applications, web services, and Zero Trust networking. File access adds an untrusted network scenario with Server Message Block over QUIC, and new encryption and signing capabilities. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth advancements also provide greater trust in connections to other devices. In addition, VPN and Windows Firewall platforms offer new ways to easily configure and debug software.

In enterprise environments, network protection works best with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, which provides detailed reporting on protection events as part of larger investigation scenarios.
