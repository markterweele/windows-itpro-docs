## :::image type="icon" source="../images/soon-button-title.svg" border="false"::: Windows Hotpatch

Windows Hotpatch is a feature designed to enhance security and minimize disruptions. With Windows Hotpatch, organizations can apply critical security updates without requiring a system restart, reducing the time to adopt a security update by 60% from the moment the update is offered. Hotpatch updates streamline the installation process, enhance compliance efficiency, and provide a per-policy level view of update statuses for all devices.

By utilizing hotpatching through Windows Autopatch, the number of system restarts for Windows updates can be reduced from 12 times a year to just 4, ensuring consistent protection and uninterrupted productivity. This means less downtime, a streamlined experience for users, and a reduction in security risks. This technology, proven in the Azure Server environment, is now expanding to Windows 11, offering immediate security from day one without the need for a restart.
