## :::image type="icon" source="../images/defender-for-endpoint.svg" border="false"::: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<sup>[\[4\]](../conclusion.md#footnote4)</sup> is an enterprise endpoint detection and response solution that helps security teams detect, disrupt, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. Organizations can use the rich event data and attack insights Defender for Endpoint provides to investigate incidents.

Defender for Endpoint brings together the following elements to provide a more complete picture of security incidents:

- Endpoint behavioral sensors: Embedded in Windows, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- With Automatic Attack Disruption uses AI, machine learning, and Microsoft Security Intelligence to analyze the entire attack and respond at the incident level, where it's able to contain a device, and/or a user which reduces the impact of attacks such as ransomware, human-operated attacks, and other advanced attacks.
- Cloud security analytics: Behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats. These analytics leverage big data, device learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products such as Microsoft 365<sup>[\[4\]](../conclusion.md#footnote4)</sup>, and online assets
- Threat intelligence: Microsoft processes over 43 trillion security signals every 24 hours, yielding a deep and broad view into the evolving threat landscape. Combined with our global team of security experts and cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can see threats that others miss. This threat intelligence helps provide unparalleled protection for our customers. The protections built into our platforms and products blocked attacks that include 31 billion identity threats and 32 billion email threats
- Rich response capabilities: Defender for Endpoint empowers SecOps teams to isolate, remediate, and remote into machines to further investigate and stop active threats in their environment, as well as block files, network destinations, and create alerts for them. In addition, Automated Investigation and Remediation can help reduce the load on the SOC by automatically performing otherwise manual steps towards remediation and providing
detailed investigation outcomes

Defender for Endpoint is also part of Microsoft Defender XDR, our end-to-end, cloud-native extended detection and response (XDR) solution that combines best-of-breed endpoint, email, and identity security products. It enables organizations to prevent, detect, investigate, and remediate attacks by delivering deep visibility, granular context, and actionable insights generated from raw signals harnessed across the Microsoft 365 environment and other
platforms, all synthesized into a single dashboard. This solution offers tremendous value to organizations of any size, especially those that are looking to break away from the added complexity of multiple point solutions, keeping them protected from sophisticated attacks and saving IT and security teams' time and resources.
