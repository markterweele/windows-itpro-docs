## Enhanced phishing protection in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen

As malware protection and other safeguards evolve, cybercriminals look for new ways to circumvent security measures. Phishing is a leading threat, with apps and websites designed to steal credentials by tricking people into voluntarily entering passwords. As a result, many organizations are transitioning to the ease and security of passwordless sign-in with Windows Hello or Windows Hello for Business.

We know that people are in different parts of their passwordless journey. To help on that journey for people still using passwords, Windows 11 offers powerful credential protection. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen now includes enhanced phishing protection to automatically detect when a user's Microsoft password is entered into any app or website. Windows then identifies if the app or site is securely authenticating to Microsoft and warns if the credentials are at risk. Because the user is alerted at the moment of potential credential theft, they can take preemptive action before the password is used against them or their organization.
