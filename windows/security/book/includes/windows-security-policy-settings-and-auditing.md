## Windows security policy settings and auditing

Security policy settings are a critical part of your overall security strategy. Windows provides a robust set of security setting policies that IT administrators can use to help protect Windows devices and other resources in your organization. Security policies settings are rules you can configure on a device, or multiple devices, to control:

- User authentication to a network or device
- Resources that users are permitted to access
- Whether to record a user or group's actions in the event log
- Membership in a group

Security auditing is one of the most powerful tools that you can use to maintain the integrity of your network and assets. Auditing can help identify attacks, network vulnerabilities, and attacks against high-value targets. You can specify categories of security-related events to create an audit policy tailored to the needs of your organization using configuration service providers (CSP) or group policies.

All auditing categories are disabled when Windows is first installed. Before enabling them, follow these steps to create an effective security auditing policy:

1. Identify your most critical resources and activities.
1. Identify the audit settings you need to track them.
1. Assess the advantages and potential costs associated with each resource or setting.
1. Test these settings to validate your choices.
1. Develop plans for deploying and managing your audit policy.
