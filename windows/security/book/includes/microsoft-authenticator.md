## Microsoft Authenticator

The Microsoft Authenticator app, which runs on iOS and Android devices, helps keeping Windows 11 users secure and productive. Microsoft Authenticator with Microsoft Entra passkeys can be used as a phish-resistant method to bootstrap Windows Hello for Business.

Microsoft Authenticator also enables easy, secure sign-in for all online accounts using multifactor authentication, passwordless phone sign-in, phishing-resistant authentication (passkeys), or password autofill. The accounts in the Authenticator app are secured with a public/private key pair in hardware-backed storage such as the Keychain in iOS and Keystore on Android. IT admins can use different tools to nudge their users to set up the Authenticator app, provide them with extra context about where the authentication is coming from, and ensure that they're actively using it.

Individual users can back up their credentials to the cloud by enabling the encrypted backup option in settings. They can also see their sign-in history and security settings for Microsoft personal, work, or school accounts.

Using this secure app for authentication and authorization enables people to be in control of how, where, and when their credentials are used. To keep up with an ever-changing security landscape, the app is constantly updated, and new capabilities are added to stay ahead of emerging threat vectors.
