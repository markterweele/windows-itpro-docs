## Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is a next-generation protection solution included in all versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11. From the moment you turn on Windows, Microsoft Defender Antivirus continually monitors for malware, viruses, and security threats. In addition to real-time protection, updates are downloaded automatically to help keep your device safe and protect it from threats. If you have another antivirus app installed and turned on, Microsoft Defender Antivirus turns off automatically. If you uninstall the other app, Microsoft Defender Antivirus turns back on.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus includes real-time, behavior-based, and heuristic antivirus protection. This combination of always-on content scanning, file and process behavior monitoring, and other heuristics effectively prevents security threats. Microsoft Defender Antivirus continually scans for malware and threats and also detects and blocks potentially unwanted applications (PUA), applications deemed to negatively impact your device but aren't considered malware.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus always-on protection is integrated with cloud-delivered protection, which helps ensure near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats. This combination of local and cloud-delivered technologies including advanced memory scanning, behavior monitoring, and machine learning, provides award-winning protection at home and at work.
