## 5G and eSIM

5G networks use stronger encryption and better network segmentation compared to previous generations of cellular protocols. Unlike Wi-Fi, 5G access is always mutually authenticated. Access credentials are stored in an EAL4-certified eSIM that is physically embedded in the device, making it much harder for attackers to tamper with. Together, 5G and eSIM provide a strong foundation for security.
