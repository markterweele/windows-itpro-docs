## Controlled folder access

You can protect your valuable information in specific folders by managing app access to them. Only trusted apps can access protected folders, which are specified when controlled folder access is configured. Typically, commonly used folders, such as those used for documents, pictures, and downloads, are included in the list of controlled folders.

Controlled folder access works with a list of trusted apps. Apps that are included in the list of trusted software work as expected. Apps that aren't included in the trusted list are prevented from making any changes to files inside protected folders.

Controlled folder access helps protect user's valuable data from malicious apps and threats such as ransomware.
