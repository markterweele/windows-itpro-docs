## :::image type="icon" source="../images/new-button-title.svg" border="false"::: Windows protected print

Windows protected print is built to provide a more modern and secure print system that maximizes compatibility and puts users first. It simplifies the printing experience by allowing devices to exclusively print using the Windows modern print stack.

The benefits of Windows protected print include:

- Increased PC security
- Simplified and consistent printing experience, regardless of PC architecture
- Removes the need to manage print drivers

Windows protected print is designed to work with Mopria certified printers only. Many existing printers are already compatible.
