        Visibility and awareness of device security and health are key to any action taken. The Windows Security app provides an at-a-glance view of the security status and health of your device. These insights help you identify issues and act to make sure you're protected. You can quickly see the status of your virus and threat protection, firewall and network security, device security controls, and more.
