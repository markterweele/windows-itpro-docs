## Wi-Fi connections

Windows Wi-Fi supports industry-standard authentication and encryption methods when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a security standard defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) to provide sophisticated data encryption and better user authentication.

The current security standard for Wi-Fi authentication is WPA3, which provides a more secure and reliable connection method as compared to WPA2 and older security protocols. Windows supports three WPA3 modes - WPA3 Personal, WPA3 Enterprise, and WPA3 Enterprise 192-bit Suite B.

Windows 11 includes WPA3 Personal with the new H2E protocol and WPA3 Enterprise 192-bit Suite B. Windows 11 also supports WPA3 Enterprise, which includes enhanced server certificate validation and TLS 1.3 for authentication using EAP-TLS authentication.

Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), a technology that allows wireless devices to establish encrypted connections to public Wi-Fi hotspots, is also included.
