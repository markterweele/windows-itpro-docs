## Account lockout policies

New devices with Windows 11 installed will have account lockout policies that are secure by default. These policies mitigate brute-force attacks such as hackers attempting to access Windows devices via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

The account lockout threshold policy is now set to 10 failed sign-in attempts by default, with the account lockout duration set to 10 minutes. The *Allow Administrator account lockout* is now enabled by default. The Reset account lockout counter after is now set to 10 minutes by default as well.
