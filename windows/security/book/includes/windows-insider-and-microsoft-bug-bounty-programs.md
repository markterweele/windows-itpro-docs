## Windows Insider and Microsoft Bug Bounty Programs

As part of our secure development process, the Windows Insider Preview Program invites eligible researchers across the globe to find and submit vulnerabilities that reproduce in the latest Windows Insider Preview (WIP) Dev Channel.

The goal of the Windows Insider Preview Program is to uncover significant vulnerabilities that have a direct and demonstrable impact on the security of customers using the latest version of Windows.

Through this collaboration with researchers across the globe, our teams identify critical vulnerabilities and quickly fix the issues before releasing our final Windows.
