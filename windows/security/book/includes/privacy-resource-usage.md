## Privacy resource usage

Every Microsoft customer should be able to use our products secure in the knowledge that we protect their privacy, and give them the information and tools they need to easily make privacy decisions with confidence. From Settings, the app usage history feature provides users with a seven-day history of resource access for Location, Camera, Microphone, Phone Calls, Messaging, Contacts, Pictures, Videos, Music library, Screenshots, and other apps.

This information helps you determine if an app is behaving as expected so that you can change the app's access to resources as desired.
