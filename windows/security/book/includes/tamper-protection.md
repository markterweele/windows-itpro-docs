## Tamper protection

Attacks like ransomware attempt to disable security features, such as anti-virus protection. Bad actors like to disable security features to get easier access to user's data, to install malware, or otherwise exploit user's data, identity, and devices without fear of being blocked. Tamper protection helps prevent these kinds of activities.

With tamper protection, malware is prevented from taking actions such as:

- Disabling real-time protection
- Turning off behavior monitoring
- Disabling antivirus protection, such as Scan all downloaded files and attachments (IOfficeAntivirus (IOAV))
- Disabling cloud-delivered protection
- Removing security intelligence updates
- Disabling automatic actions on detected threats
- Disabling archived files
- Altering exclusions
- Disabling notifications in the Windows Security app
