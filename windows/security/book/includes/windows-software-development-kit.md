## Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)

Developers can design highly secure applications that benefit from the latest Windows 11 safeguards using the Windows SDK. The SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools for developing secure desktop apps for Windows 11 and Windows 10. To help create apps that are up to date and protected, the SDK follows the same security standards, protocols, and compliance as the core Windows operating system.
