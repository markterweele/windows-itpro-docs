## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. TPMs provide security and privacy benefits for system hardware, platform owners, and users. Windows Hello, BitLocker, System Guard, and other Windows features rely on the TPM for capabilities such as key generation, secure storage, encryption, boot integrity measurements, and attestation. These capabilities in turn help organizations strengthen the protection of their identities and data. The 2.0 version of TPM includes support for newer algorithms, which provides improvements like support for stronger cryptography. To upgrade to Windows 11, existing Windows 10 devices much meet minimum system requirements for CPU, RAM, storage, firmware, TPM, and more. All new Windows 11 devices come with TPM 2.0 built-in. With Windows 11, both new and upgraded devices must have TPM 2.0. The requirement strengthens the security posture across all Windows 11 devices and helps ensure that these devices can benefit from future security capabilities that depend on a hardware root-of-trust.
