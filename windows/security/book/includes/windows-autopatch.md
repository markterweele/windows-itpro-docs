## Windows Autopatch

Cybercriminals commonly exploit obsolete or unpatched software to infiltrate networks. It's essential to maintain current updates to seal security gaps. Windows Autopatch is a cloud service that automates Windows, Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Teams updates to improve security and productivity across your organization. Autopatch helps you minimize the involvement of your scarce IT resources in the planning and deployment of updates so your IT Admins can focus on other activities and tasks.
