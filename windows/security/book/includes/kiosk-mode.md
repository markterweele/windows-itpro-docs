## Kiosk mode

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Windows allows you to restrict functionality to specific applications using built-in features, making it ideal for public-facing or shared devices like kiosks. You can set up Windows as a kiosk either locally on the device, or through a cloud-based device management solution like Microsoft Intune<sup>[\[7\]](../conclusion.md#footnote7)</sup>. Kiosk mode can be configured to run a single app, multiple apps, or a full-screen web browser. You can also configure the device to automatically sign in and launch the designated kiosk app at startup.
