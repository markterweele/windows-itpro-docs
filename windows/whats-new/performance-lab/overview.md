# Windows Performance Lab Overview

At Microsoft, we believe that trust is built on transparency, and excellence is driven by accuracy. That is why, in early 2025, we established the Windows Performance Lab—a dedicated team committed to delivering rigorous, data-backed performance insights that empower the entire Windows ecosystem. By providing a centralized source for information about performance testing, we aim to promote the adoption of a consistent approach to benchmark testing across the ecosystem, provide our partners and customers with transparency and build trust in our performance claims. This is especially critical as we usher in a new era of Windows innovation with Copilot+ PCs, where performance and AI experiences go hand in hand. Our mission is clear:

- **Deliver accuracy** in performance claims through a transparent methodology.
- **Empower our ecosystem**—OEMs, silicon partners, retailers, and commercial partners—to highlight the power of Windows devices and the category of Copilot+ PCs with confidence.
- **Strengthen trust in the Windows brand** by ensuring performance claims are backed by meticulous testing and clear, substantiated data.

As technology evolves, so will our commitment to accuracy, transparency, and innovation. We will continue updating and expanding this resource and providing the latest performance insights.

> The Windows Performance Lab focuses on validating key performance claims for a selection of benchmarks through a standardized, transparent testing methodology. Benchmark results represent performance under specific conditions and should not be viewed as definitive across all scenarios. Actual performance may vary depending on the selected benchmark or workload, device configuration, usage patterns, environment, and other factors. Additionally, the results reflect testing conducted as of the dates indicated and may not account for subsequent updates. For a comprehensive evaluation, consult additional sources, including performance information provided by the original equipment manufacturer for the specific configuration you are considering.
>
> Not every performance or power claim made across the Windows ecosystem is tested or published in this resource. If you are looking for data supporting a specific claim that is not available here, we recommend referring to the original product documentation or marketing material where the claim was made. This is an evolving resource, and we are committed to expanding our coverage and deepening our insights as new technologies and devices emerge.
