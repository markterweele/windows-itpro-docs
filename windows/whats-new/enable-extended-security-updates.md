# Enable Extended Security Updates (ESU)
<!--10014911-->
> **Looking for consumer information?**  For individuals or Windows 10 Home customers, more information about Extended Security Updates for Windows 10 is available in the frequently asked questions section of the [End of support for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/end-of-support) page.<!--10013381-->

The Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) program allows organizations to receive critical and important security updates for PCs enrolled in the paid subscription service. ESU extends the use of Windows 10 devices past the end of support date on October 14, 2025. This article provides instructions on how to enable the ESU keys in commercial environments.

## Prerequisites

To enable ESU for Windows 10, you must meet the following prerequisites:

**Client operating system:**
- Windows 10, version 22H2 with [KB5046613](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5046613), or a later update installed
- Administrative privileges on the device

**Endpoints for client activation:**
- https://go.microsoft.com/
- https://go.microsoft.com/
- https://login.live.com
- https://activation.sls.microsoft.com/
- http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicProSecSerCA_2007-12-04.crl
- https://validation.sls.microsoft.com/
- https://activation-v2.sls.microsoft.com/

- https://displaycatalog.mp.microsoft.com/
- https://licensing.mp.microsoft.com/
- https://purchase.mp.microsoft.com/
- https://displaycatalog.md.mp.microsoft.com/

**Microsoft 365 admin center:**

[Volume licensing access](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/vl-sign-in) to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) for volume licensing

## Get the product keys for activating Extended Security Update (ESU) licenses

If you bought ESU licenses, you can activate them with Multiple Activation Keys (MAK) that you get from the admin center. To find the ESU license MAK, use the following steps:

1. In the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to the **Billing** > **Your Products** page, then select the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2244144" target="_blank">Volume licensing</a> tab.
2. In the **Contracts** section, select **View contracts**.  
3. On the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2297440" target="_blank">Contracts</a> page, find the **License ID** that the ESU licenses were purchased under, select the three dots (**More actions**), then select **View product keys**. The **Product keys** details page includes contract details and a list of all keys for that contract.

> [!NOTE]
> You can order ESU licenses before the start of the ESU coverage period. However, the ESU MAK displayed in the Product keys details panel isn't usable until the defined ESU coverage period begins. For more information, see [Product Lifecycle FAQ - Extended Security Updates](/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates).

## Install and activate the ESU key

The device needs access to the internet and to Microsoft Activation Servers. If the device can't access either the internet or the Microsoft Activation Servers, see [Activate ESU keys by phone](#activate-esu-keys-by-phone) To install the ESU key on clients, use the following steps:

1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window on the device.
1. Run the following command to install the ESU key, replacing `<ESU MAK>` with the actual ESU MAK you obtained in the previous section:

   ```cmd
   slmgr.vbs /ipk <ESU MAK>
   ```
  After you run this command, you should see a Windows Script Host dialog box that states the product key was installed successfully.

1. Find the ESU Activation ID using the following table:
   | ESU Program | Activation ID |
   |---|---|
   |Win10 ESU Year1| f520e45e-7413-4a34-a497-d2765967d094 |
   |Win10 ESU Year2| 1043add5-23b1-4afb-9a0f-64343c8f3f8d |
   |Win10 ESU Year3| 83d49986-add3-41d7-ba33-87c7bfb5c0fb |
   
   > [!Note]
   > The activation IDs are the same across all eligible Windows ESU editions and all devices enrolled for that program
1. From the elevated Command Prompt window, run the following command to activate the ESU key, replacing `<Activation ID>` with the actual ESU Activation ID you obtained in the previous step:

   ```cmd
   slmgr.vbs /ato <Activation ID>
   ```
    After you run this command, you should see a Windows Script Host dialog box that states the product was activated successfully.
1. To verify that the ESU key is installed and activated, run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt:

   ```cmd
   slmgr.vbs /dli
   ```

   The output should show the **Name** of the corresponding ESU program and the **License Status** as `Licensed` for that program.

## Activate ESU keys by phone

If the device doesn't have access to the internet or to the Microsoft Activation Servers, use the following steps fo a manual phone activation:
